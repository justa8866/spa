Task description:

[X] The goal of the task is to implement SPA application with just one view.

[X] You should use the below API endpoint to display the paginated list of products.

[X] At the top of the view, there should be text input, which allows the user to filter results by id. The input should accept only numbers, other signs should not even appear.

[X] Below this input user should see a table displaying the following items’
properties: id, name, and year. Additionally, the background colour of each row should be taken from the colour property. After clicking on a row a modal should be displayed and should present all item data. The table should display 5 items per page. Under the table, there should be a pagination component, which allows switching between pages with “next” and “previous” arrows.

[X] Please remember about handling situations when API endpoint returns a 4XX or 5XX error. In such a case the user should be informed about the error.

[X] Your app should start after running npm install & npm start.

[X] Please reflect pagination and filtering in the address URL, so users can copy and share the URL with each other.

[X] add Redux/Context API or other state management library


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
